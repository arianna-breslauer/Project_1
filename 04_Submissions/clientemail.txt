The World Data Science Foundation is planning a Parade of 3 Million Data Scientists in New York City to celebrate World Data Day. It will be the world's largest Parade, and we want  march in Midtown and are considering a route up Fifth Avenue. The parade will start at about 42nd Street and will end around 79th street, as per past parades. 

We will provide volunteers at key subway stations to assist with crowd control. Please analyze MTA traffic data to provide a recommendation on how to best deploy volunteer guides in the vicinity of the parade.

Best Regards,
- World Data Science Foundation
